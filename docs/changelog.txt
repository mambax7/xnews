<h5>1.67 (BETA)(BETA)(BETA)(BETA) UTF-8 & Clonable</h5>
<hr>

I needed a cloanable news module and one that worked correctly with xlanguage and UTF-8 so I decided to start a new news branch. 

I had to decide on two ways to face the problem. One was that i could write a cloner file with a long list of files to be parsed and renamed in every needed spot and the other to use an automatic parser of files that only changes prefixes and a few file names like the clone file in Oledrion. The first was disregarded only because at every code modification one has to keep track of every single change and update the cloner file by hand, in the second case nothing has to be done all prefixes are parsed removing conflicts between cloned modules. Its fast and reliable. Below are some of the changes I made.

Called module xNews to keep original news module as is. No overwriting. 

!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Please upgrade your News module to 1.64-5-6 before installing xNews if you have intention to import data from original - it has not been tested on previous versions.

!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Importing original News module 1.64-5-6 data - On install xNews activates import button only if xNews stories table is empty therefore if you want to import data you should do this right after install and before doing anything else - Import will not work from clones. You can still work creating and adding news to clones without touching xNews data until you decide to import original news data.

I have tested the module on linux - Apache 2 - php 5 -mysql 5 - xoops 2.4.x - 2.5.x working fine.
Has to be tested on windows.

I am writing a short help file eventhough changes are self explanatory and module works the same way.


- New News clonable, UTF-8 only branch
- Complete 2.4.x and 2.5.0 alpha 2 compatability 
- Modified all files and code for multiple news module install and easy cloning

	- _AM_XNEWS_ for admin
	- _MD_XNEWS_ for main
	- _MI_XNEWS_ for modinfo
	- _MB_XNEWS_ for blocks
	- Other languages can be added after canging incomplete prefixes 
	  on standard news modules and adding the last added lines language defines
	  using notepad++, geany - search/replace functions.

	- italian
	- french

	- change all function nw_ prefix's to New Prefix
	- create new directory

- Substituted all /module/xnews/ dir and url references with header.php defines
- Added permission setting on install
- Added data importer from normal news module automatic on install

	- Table will only be deleted when Original xNews module will 
	  be uninstalled and only after all other clones have been uninstalled first.
- Added Install-Uninstall from cloner admin. Only from Original xNews module.
- Cloner Admin menu from clones will be redirected to xNews module Admin

  This option is used for printable versions of your articles.

  your document. For more information, see this links :
  	http://www.alistapart.com/articles/improvingprint/
  	http://www.easy-designs.net/code/footnoteLinks/
  Don't forget to print or to preview your document to be able to see the links !
> A </head> tag was missing in the printable version of an article

> Some corrections in the french translation
> I have removed the static word "Page" from the templates (and added it to the

> Inside article.php, you can now use the following Smarty variables :
	<{$story.poster_avatar}>
	<{$story.poster_signature}>
	<{$story.poster_email}>
	<{$story.poster_url}>
	<{$story.poster_from}>
> I have added a link, in the module's administration, to maintain the module's
  tables. This will optimize, check and analyze the tables in the database.
> I have added a new option to activate Dublin Core Metadata in the article's
  page. For more explanations, see http://dublincore.org/
  Dublin Core Metadata are, as the name state, a set of meta datas used to
  describe your documents.
  If you are a Firefox user, you can use this extension to visualize the Dublin
  Meta Datas :
  	https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/528/
> You can display a "Bookmark this article at these sites" on the article's page
	To see an example, look at the bottom of this article :
	http://ajax.phpmagazine.net/2006/11/ajaxcore_new_php_framework_rel.html
> You can use Firefox 2 Micro summaries : http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries
  If someone bookmark your page with Firefox 2 he can choose to see the last
  title of your last news instead of the current page's title.
  The news module modifies the meta datas of all its page to include a line
  like this one :
  <link rel="microsummary" href="http://www.example.com/modules/xnews/micro_summary.php" />
  but you can also add it in your theme so that when someone bookmark your site
  from any page he can get your micro summary.
  With FireFox 2, you can use this extension :
	  https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3639/
> You have a new page called "Who's who" showing your visitors a list or the
  authors of the site (this page is only visible if you have activated the
  "news by this author" option)
  This page can be seen from the Xoops menu (or directly to /modules/xnews/whoswho.php)
> A complete new metagen. You can select the number of generated meta keywords,
  select the keywords order and manage a blacklist. Blacklisted words will not
  be used for the keywords.
> You have a new page to display a topics directory ("Topics Directory)
  You can access it from the standard Xoops menu or directly from
  http://www.example.com/modules/xnews/topics_directory.php
> You can display advertisements in your articles.
  There is a new module option that you can use for this.
  Everything that you type is rendered in the module's templates.
  In the page used to see a full article (article.php), the advertisement is
  shown between the Scoop and the extended text.
  In all the other pages, you have a Smarty tag called <{$advertisement}> that
  you can place where you want.
> You can manage topics permissions from the topic's form (in the module's
  administration) while you are creating or editing a topic.
> You can enter the authorized mime types to join files in the module's options.
  Enter all the mimetypes you want separated by a new line.
> In the module's administration, where you can create a newsletter's content,
  you can now select to remove html tags and you can add an header and a footer.
> In your articles, you can now replace the syntax used to separate pages with
  a new one (thanks Bender)
  To be able to use it, you must, in the modules option, select the suitable
  option ("Use enhanced page navigator ?")
  Then, to use it, inside your articles, you can separate pages like this
  (imagine this is the content or your article) :
	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit,
	[pagebreak: Here is my page 2]
	sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam.
	Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper
	nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
	[pagebreak: This is the development]
	Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse,
	vel illum dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis at vero eros et
	[pagebreak: Conclusion]
	accumsan et iusto odio dignissim qui blandit praesent luptatum zzril
	delenit augue duis dolore te feugait nulla facilisi.

  Notes :
	- The old syntax ([pagebreak]) is still available
	- Your text inside the brackets DOES NOT HAVE TO CONTAIN [ or ]
	- The syntax is not case sensitive

  You can also, now, use, inside your articles, the new "meta variable" [summary].
  This will automatically create a summary by using the pages titles you gave in
  the [pagebreak] "tag".

> The generation of PDFs was updated with the CBB's code.

Finally, the module was succesfully tested with Php 5.0.4
Many tests were made with phpcoverage and xdebug to be sure that early all the code was treated by Php that's why I can affirm that the module is Php 5 compatible.



<h5>1.31 RC2</h5>
<hr>
Corrections :
> There was a bug int the "randon news" block when you was selecting to use only one or zero stories (thank you domifara)
> I have, again, corrected a bug in the comments links (thank you mczolton)
> The "recent news" block was not respecting permissions in classical mode
> When you was using the standard dhtml Xoops editor in the Topics Manager, you was not able to use the editor's buttons (thank you eric_juden)
> I have replaced, in the users part, all the relative paths to absolute paths (this is usefull when you are using shorturls for example)
> Some minor corrections in the templates
> Some bugs corrections in the "view by topics" view. First the permissions was not respected and there were warnings.
> I have corrected a bug in the "notify publisher" option
> I have removed some warnings in the "recent news" block
> A bug was affecting many parts of the module concerning the permissions
> I have removed some warnings in the "random news" block
> The option "Publish in frontpage" available for each topic was not always used
> The topics list contained in the form used to create stories was not respecting permissions (bug introduced in the 1.3.1 version only).

Additions/Changes :
> I have added, in the module's index page and in the article's page, two new Smarty vars :
       	topic_title - Wich will only contains the news topic (with a ilnk)
       	news_title - Wich will only contains the news title (with a link)
 This will respond to the often asked question, "how to remove the topic's title from the news title.
 It's available in the module's index page and in the article's page.
 Suggestion made by ralf57
> In the index page, when you was viewing a topic and where there were no articles inside it, nothing was visible. Now you can see, at least
  and if you have selected it, the navigation's bar
> In the part wich is responsible to generate keywords automatically, I have added an "option" so that the default keywords defined in the
  preferences are returned when the module can't compute any keyword.
> In the topics manager, by default the topics was created as a submenu of the "news" item, that's not the case anymore



<h5>1.31 RC1</h5>

> It was not possible to join zip files to the news

Additions/Changes :
> I have added, in the module's admin part, the same system that you can find in some modules (like smartfaq) to collapse some parts of the screen

		<{$block.topic_description}>   			<{$block.topic_image}>
		<{$block.spotlight.topic_description}>	<{$block.spotlight.topic_image}>
  Still in those blocks, the "read more" link is not anymore visible if there's nothing more to see/read.
> If you have NOT selected to enter the meta description and keywords or if you have selected to enter them but did not made it for the current article
  then the module will generate them automatically (like smartsection but with my own "engine" ;-) ).
> The module is capable to detect when a bot is reading the news to generate links to every pages from the module's index page.
  It can also generate links for every pages of an article.
  Idea suggested by xoops-tips and multimenu from Solo71, thank you both !
> The module can search inside the articles comments (and it respects the permissions).
  If you don't want to use this feature, edit the file called /xoops/modules/xnews/include/search.inc.php and replace this line :
  	$searchincomments=true;
  with :
  	$searchincomments=false;
> I have modified the files called /xoops/pda.php and /xoops/backend.php. They will now respect the permissions and will display the
  same number of news that the module's option called "Select the number of news items to display on top page"


<h5>1.3 Definitive</h5>
