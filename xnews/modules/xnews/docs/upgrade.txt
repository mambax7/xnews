**                            UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS                           **
*******************************************************************************
Here is the list of actions you will have to do to upgrade from any previous
version :

1) Delete all files in modules/xnews
2) Upload all files in this package.
3) Update the xNews module in system admin -> modules
3) Launch the following script at least one time :
	http://www.example.com/modules/xnews/admin/upgrade.php
   To be able to launch it, YOU MUST BE AN ADMIN OF THE NEWS MODULE
   Once this script has been launched, you can remove it but it's not "vital"
4) If you are using a personalized template set (if you have cloned it for
   example) :
   Go in admin -> templates. Find the templates set you are using, beside the
   name "xNews" click on the link named "[List (11)]". Find the template called
   "nw_news_index.html" then press the link named "[Delete]". In the next screen,
   when you see this question "Are you sure that you want to delete this template data?"
   validate by pressing "Yes". The previous screen will reappears and you will see
   a yellow line, click on the link named "[Generate]"

5) If you are using the default template set. First create some test news then
   go on the part of your website where your users can see the news (for example
   http://www.example.com/modules/xnews). If you can see the test news, come back
   to the admin part of your site. Go in the news module's preferences and for
   the option named "News Display Layout" select "By topic". Come back to the
   visible part of your website (http://www.example.com/modules/xnews).
   If you can see your news, ignore the rest of this point, else, if you
   can't see the news then, in admin -> templates, beside the default template
   set, click on the link named "Clone", give it a name then go in
   admin -> preferences, select "General Settings" and in the scrolling list
   called "Default template set", select the template you have previously
   cloned.

If you are doing a fresh install, you don't have to do anything from the previous
list.
